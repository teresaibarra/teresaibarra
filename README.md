### Howdy! I'm Teresa ╰( ･ ᗜ ･ )╯

I worked at Datadog as a software engineer a few years and I'm currently wrapping up my batch at Recurse Center.

I graduated from Harvey Mudd College with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020, with a concentration on AI and ML. I previously interned at Bloomberg, Slack, IBM Design, Stitch Fix, CircleCI, and Industrial Light & Magic.
