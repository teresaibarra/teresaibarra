### Howdy! I'm Teresa ‚ï∞( ÔΩ• ·óú ÔΩ• )‚ïØ

I worked at [Datadog](http://datadoghq.com) as a software engineer a few years and I'm currently wrapping up my batch at [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com).

I graduated from [Harvey Mudd](http://hmc.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020, with a concentration on AI and ML. I previously interned at [Bloomberg](http://bloomberg.com), [Slack](https://slack.com), [IBM Design](https://www.ibm.com/design/), [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), and [Industrial Light & Magic](https://www.ilm.com).

üå± **Currently learning:** [better programming skills](https://missing.csail.mit.edu); [best practices](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/); [practical user experience](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/); audio programming tools like [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max)
